[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/soumak77/hackathon-starter-pack.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/soumak77/hackathon-starter-pack)

## Requirements
You'll need the following software installed to get started.

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): Use the installer for your OS.

## Get Started

Clone this repository, where `app` is the name of your app.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:base-apps/angular-firebase-template.git starter
```

Change into the directory.

```bash
cd starter
```

Install the dependencies. If you're running Mac OS or Linux, you may need to run `sudo npm install` instead, depending on how your machine is configured.

```bash
npm install
```

While you're working on your project, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will compile your front end resource and assemble your Angular app.
**Now go to `localhost:3333` in your browser to see it in action.**
